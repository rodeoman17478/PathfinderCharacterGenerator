Role: 
	Rogues excel at moving about unseen and
	catching foes unaware, and tend to avoid head-to-head
	combat. Their varied skills and abilities allow them to
	be highly versatile, with great variations in expertise
	existing between different rogues. Most, however, excel in
	overcoming hindrances of all types, from unlocking doors
	and disarming traps to outwitting magical hazards and
	conning dull-witted opponents.
