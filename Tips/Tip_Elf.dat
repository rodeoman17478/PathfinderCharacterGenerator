Description:
	The long-lived Elves are children of the natural world, similar in many 
	superficial ways to fey creatures, yet "different as well. Elves value 
	their privacy and traditions, and while they are often slow to make 
	friends, at both the personal and national levels, once an outsider is 
	accepted as a comrade, such alliances can last for generations. Elves 
	have a curious attachment to their surroundings, perhaps as a result of 
	their incredibly long lifespans or some deeper, more mystical reason. 
	Elves who dwell in a region for long find themselves physically adapting 
	to match their surroundings, most noticeably taking on coloration 
	reflecting the local environment. Those elves that spend their lives
	among the short-lived races, on the other hand, often develop a skewed 
	perception of mortality and "become morose, the result of watching wave 
	after wave of companions age and die before their eyes. Elves get 
	+2 Dexterity, + 2 Intelligence and -2 Constitution.
