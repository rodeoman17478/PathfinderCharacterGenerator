Role: 
	Sorcerers excel at casting a selection of favored
	spells frequently, making them powerful battle mages. As
	they become familiar with a specific and ever-widening set
	of spells, sorcerers often discover new and versatile ways of
	making use of magics other spellcasters might overlook. Their
	bloodlines also grant them additional abilities, assuring that
	no two sorcerers are ever quite alike.
