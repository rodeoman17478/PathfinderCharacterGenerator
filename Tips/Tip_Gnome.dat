Description:
	Gnomes trace their lineage back to the mysterious realm of the fey, a 
	place where colors are brighter, the wildlands wilder, and emotions more 
	primal. Unknown forces drove the ancient gnomes from that realm long ago, 
	forcing them to seek refuge in this world; despite this, the gnomes have 
	never completely abandoned their fey roots or adapted to mortal culture. 
	As a result, gnomes are widely regarded by the other races as alien and 
	strange.Gnomes get +2 Constitution, +2 Charisma and -2 Strength.
