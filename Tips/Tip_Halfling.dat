Description:
	Optimistic and cheerful by nature, blessed with uncanny luck and driven 
	by a powerful wanderlust, Halflings make up for their short stature with 
	an abundance of bravado and curiosity. At once excitable and easy-going, 
	half lings like to keep an even temper and a steady eye on opportunity, 
	and are not as prone as some of the more volatile races to violent or 
	emotional outbursts. Even in the jaws of catastrophe, a half ling almost 
	never loses his sense of humor. Half lings are inveterate opportunists. 
	Unable to physically defend themselves from the rigors of the world, they 
	know when to bend with the wind and when to hide away. Yet a half ling’s 
	curiosity often overwhelms his good sense, leading to poor decisions and 
	narrow escapes. Though their curiosity drives them to travel and seek new 
	places and experiences, half lings possess a strong sense of house and 
	home, often spending above their means to enhance the comforts of home 
	life. Halflings get +2 Dexterity, +2 Charisma and -2 Strength.
