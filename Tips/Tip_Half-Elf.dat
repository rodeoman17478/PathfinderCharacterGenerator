Description:
	Half-Elves have long drawn the covetous gazes of other races. Their 
	generous life spans, magical aff inity, and inherent grace each 
	contribute to the admiration or bitter envy of their neighbors. Of all
	their traits, however, none so entrance their human associates as their 
	beauty. Since the two races first came into contact with each other,
	the humans have held up Elves as models of physical perfection, seeing 
	in the fair folk idealized versions of themselves. For their part, many 
	Elves find humans attractive despite their comparatively barbaric ways, 
	drawn to the passion and impetuosity with which members of the younger 
	race play out their brief lives. Sometimes this mutual infatuation leads 
	to romantic relationships. Though usually short-lived, even by human 
	standards, these trysts commonly lead to the birth of half-elves, a race 
	descended of two cultures yet inheritor of neither. Halfelves can breed 
	with one another, but even these “pureblood” half-elves tend to be viewed 
	as bastards by humans and elves alike. Half-elves get a +2 bonus to one 
	ability score of their choice at creation to represent their varied nature.
