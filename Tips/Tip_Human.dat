Description:
	Humans possess exceptional drive and a great capacity to endure and 
	expand, and as such are currently the dominant race in the world. Their 
	empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and the citizens of 
	these societies carve names for themselves with the strength of their 
	sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is best characterized 
	by its tumultuousness and diversity, and human cultures run the gamut 
	from savage but honorable tribes to decadent, devil-worshiping noble 
	families in the most cosmopolitan cities. Human curiosity and ambition 
	often triumph over their predilection for a sedentary lifestyle, and 
	many leave their homes to explore the innumerable forgotten corners of 
	the world or lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors, simply 
	because they can. Humans get a +2 bonus to one ability score of their 
	choice at creation to represent their varied nature.
