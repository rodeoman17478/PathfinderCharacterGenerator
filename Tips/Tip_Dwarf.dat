Description:
	Dwarves are a stoic but stern race, ensconced in cities carved from the 
	hearts of mountains and fiercely determined to repel the depredations of 
	savage races like orcs and goblins. More than any other race, the dwarves
	have acquired a reputation as dour and humorless craftsmen of the earth. 
	It could be said that dwarven history shapes the dark disposition of many 
	dwarves, for they reside in high mountains and dangerous realms below 
	the earth, constantly at war with giants, goblins, and other such horrors. 
	Dwarves get +2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom and -2 Charisma.
