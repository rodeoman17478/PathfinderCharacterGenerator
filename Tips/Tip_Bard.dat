Role: 
	Bards capably confuse and confound their foes
	while inspiring their allies to ever-greater daring. While
	accomplished with both weapons and magic, the true
	strength of bards lies outside melee, where they can
	support their companions and undermine their foes
	without fear of interruptions to their performances.
