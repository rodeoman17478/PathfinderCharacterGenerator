Role: 
	More than capable of upholding the honor of their
	deities in battle, clerics often prove stalwart and capable
	combatants. Their true strength lies in their capability to
	draw upon the power of their deities, whether to
	increase their own and their allies’ prowess in
	battle, to vex their foes with divine magic, or to lend 
	healing to companions in need.As their powers are influenced 
	by their faith, all clerics must focus their worship
	upon a divine source. While the vast majority of clerics 
	revere a specif ic deity, a small number dedicate themselves 
	to a divine concept worthy of devotion—such as battle, death, 
	justice, or knowledge free of a deific abstraction. 
	(Work with your GM if you prefer this path to selecting a 
	specif ic deity.)
