Role: 
	While universalist wizards might study to prepare
	themselves for any manner of danger, specialist wizards
	research schools of magic that make them exceptionally
	skilled within a specific focus. Yet no matter their
	specialty, all wizards are masters of the impossible and can
	aid their allies in overcoming any danger.
