Description:
	Half-orcs are monstrosities, their tragic births the result of perversion 
	and violence—or at least, that’s how other races see them. It’s true that 
	half-orcs are rarely the result of loving unions, and as such are usually 
	forced to grow up hard and fast, constantly fighting for protection or to 
	make names for themselves. Feared, distrusted, and spat upon, half-orcs 
	still consistently manage to surprise their detractors with great deeds 
	and unexpected wisdom— though sometimes it’s easier just to crack a few 
	skulls. Half-orcs get a +2 bonus to one ability score of their choice at 
	creation to represent their varied nature.
