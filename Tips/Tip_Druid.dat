Role: 
	While some druids might keep to the fringe of
	battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures
	to fight while they confound foes with the powers of
	nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely
	wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of
	elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically
	this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are
	just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods,
	or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.
